# What is Software Engineering?

We see three critical differences between programming and software engineering: time, 
scale and the trade-offs at play.
On a software engineering project, engineers need to be more concerned with the passage
of time and the eventual need for change.
In a software engineering organization, we need to be more concerned about scale and 
efficiency, both for the software we produce as well as for the organization that is 
producing it.
Finally, as software engineers, we are asked to make more complex decisions with 
higher-stakes outcomes, often based on imprecise estimates of time and growth. 

Within Google, we say, "Software engineering is programming integrated over time". 
We might need to delineate between programming tasks (development) and software
engineering tasks (development, modification, maintenance). The addition of time 
adds an important new dimension to programming. 

One way to see the impact of time on a program is to think about the question, 
"What is the expected life span of your code?" It is just as reasonable to think
of code that needs to last for a few minutes as it is to imagine code that will live
for decades. Short-lived systems are effectively "just" a programming problem.
As we expand that time to allow for longer life spans, change becomes more important.
Over a span of a decade or more, most program dependencies, whether implicit or 
explicit, will likely change. This recognition is at the root of our distinction 
between software engineering and programming.
